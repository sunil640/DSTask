List of Classifiers
#Logistic Regression
#Random Forest Classifier



Explanation-

1)In the given data set i have did the EDA,Preprocrssing,Feature Selection,Model selection,model creation & prediction.

2)If you will go through the jupyter notebook given, you can clearliy see that with logistic regression model we are not getting much accuracy.

3)After EDA visulaization of data set we concluded that the in the data set only feature X55,X56,X57 is important features all other features has O values more than 25% of total data hence we are have not selected those features for prediction.

4)In  Visualization we can See that X55,X56,X57 coulunms have are highly skewd so i decided th chose the random forest classifier to overcome the skewness and better accuracy.

5)I have also tried here to acchive maximum accuracy with hyperparametr tuning but not getting accuracy more than 84%, thats even on default parameter.**
